# 3D Models Directory

Place your GLB/GLTF model files here.

## How to get NASA spacecraft models:

1. **NASA 3D Resources**: https://nasa3d.arc.nasa.gov/models
2. **NASA's Swift Observatory**: https://nasa3d.arc.nasa.gov/detail/swift
3. **Other spacecraft models**: https://nasa3d.arc.nasa.gov/detail/spacecraft

## File naming:
- Place your model as `Swift.glb` in this directory
- Or rename your model file to match the import in the component

## Supported formats:
- .glb (recommended - single file)
- .gltf (with separate .bin and texture files)

## File size:
- Keep models under 10MB for web performance
- Compress if needed using tools like gltf-pipeline
